I am from Suryapet, India. I completed my undergraduate in computer science at CVR College of  Engineering, Hyderabad. I am currently graduating in Applied Computer Science from Northwest Missouri State University.  I have to gain more knowledge in data bases and improve my technical skills. I would like to become full stack developer.
